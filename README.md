# Machine-Learning-Model-for-GDP-Per-Capita

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between important factors that may define a country’s level of development - climate change impact, healthcare infrastructure, and education/employment - and the country’s GDP per capita as a proxy for growth. We aim to build robust models to predict GDP per capita using these factors and in the process, elucidate the factors that can most impact a country’s GDP per capita growth, and consequently development. By April 9th, only 0.2% of the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines had made it to lowest-income countries and less than 25% to low-middle income  countries, yet these countries represent an immense majority of the global population, including countries like India, Vietnam, and Nigeria. This disproportionate distribution of the vaccine, and hence a country's ability to respond to the pandemic, is indicative of an underlying issue among countries: the growing economic inequality between the most developed and least developed countries.

Not surprisingly, this inequity manifests at many different facets, most prominently within the environmental, social, and health contexts for each country. These factors, together, are important for defining a country’s development and this project aims to elucidate the relationship between these three factors and the economic growth of a country, which we represent with GDP. We also aim to extrapolate which one of these three aspects might be the largest factor in determining the economic state of a country.

Outline of Project:

1. Acquire and Wrangle Data from World Bank and WHO Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Transforming Data for ML Models
4. Building Regression Models and Neural Network
5. Conclusion

**NOTE: The notebook sometimes might not render within GitHub due to its large size so it usually works after refreshing it a couple of times. Alternatively, you can view it by downloading the file and viewing it in Jupyter or Google Colab
